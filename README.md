# CT14: Non-Comparison Sorts

## Overview

Non-comparison sorting algorithms that exploit properties of the data to sort faster than O(n log n). Covers counting sort, bucket sort, and radix sort — the "bucket sort" family required by CCD 2.8.4.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand why non-comparison sorts can beat O(n log n)
- Implement counting sort using a frequency array
- Implement bucket sort with range-based distribution
- Implement radix sort using counting sort as a subroutine
- Analyze Big O speed, space, and when each is appropriate

### `BucketSorts.cpp` — 3 TODOs

1. `counting_sort` — count occurrences, place directly
2. `bucket_sort` — distribute into buckets, sort each, concatenate
3. `radix_sort` — sort by each digit using counting sort
